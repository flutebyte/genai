# 🧩 GenAI Experiments & Mini Projects

This folder is a collection of my hands-on experiments, prototypes, and practice scripts related to **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, and **ML workflows**.  
Each subfolder contains a small, focused project exploring a specific concept — from running local LLMs to testing tokenizers, building chat loops, or trying out model inference.

The goal of this repository is simple:  
📌 Learn by building  
📌 Explore GenAI fundamentals  
📌 Understand how things work under the hood

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

Each project will include:
- A dedicated folder  
- Clean Python scripts  
- A README explaining the concept  
- Notes on what I learned from the experiment  

Examples of experiments in this repo:
- Running GPT-2 locally on CPU  
- Playing with tokenization  
- Testing generation parameters (temperature, sampling, etc.)  
- Simple chatbots  
- Prompt engineering trials  
- Small NLP utilities  

More experiments will be added regularly as I learn new concepts.
